    <a href="https://www.effectiveacceleration.org/" target="_blank">E/ACC</a>
    <P>The only way to solve humanites greatest problems is by outgrowing them,any technologgical revolution has always improved humanity.</P>
    <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/" target="_blank">TECHNO OPTIMIST MANIFESTO</a>
    <p>technology – new knowledge, new tools, what the Greeks called techne – has always been the main source of growth, and perhaps the only cause of growth, as technology made both population growth and natural resource utilization possible.</p>
    <h4>CHANGE(Steve Jobs)</h4>
    <P>Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you, and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.</P>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/sama" target="_blank">DELUSION (@sama)</a>
    <P>Self-belief is immensely powerful. The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion.</P>
